# Flying-Sensor-Node

Environment monitoring is of utmost importance in many indoor and outdoor applications. Wireless sensor networks are not always feasible in dynamic environments and hence a flying sensor node could be deployed in such cases. An indoor and outdoor flying sensor node has been attempted to get temperature and humidity values to the user through a web interface along with other features such as remote tracking and control.
